        Nelson Mandela (1918â€“2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and humanitarian who became the country's first Black president from 1994 to 1999. He spent 27 years in prison for opposing apartheid, a system of racial segregation enforced by the white minority government. After his release in 1990, he played a key role in peacefully ending apartheid and uniting the country through reconciliation efforts. Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and is celebrated worldwide for his leadership, courage, and commitment to justice and equality. His legacy lives on through Mandela Day, observed on July 18 to promote community service and human rights.
